# Swagger React Admin Generator
Convert Swagger specifications into a simple React Admin client.

## Introduction
This utility parses a Swagger specification and generates a simple React Admin client implementation to integration with a given data provider.
The purpose of this tool is to generate all the CRUD, Filter and base elements of a React Admin setup with a defined swagger specification. The tool includes a basic setup for authentication and management, but those can be controlled and overwritten once the generation is done.

## Note

This tool is currently under construction and will be completed and probably moved else where soon. Check in a few days/weeks.
